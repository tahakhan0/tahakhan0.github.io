Hi ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Taha Khan. I work as a backend engineer at [Octopus Energy](https://octopusenergy.com/) and I'm currently a team lead for the Octopus Energy USA API team. 

I usually blog about things that I've learned and found interesting to be shared. I follow three main principles (according to me):

- Get a working demo as soon as possible. All the blogs/youtube tutorials can come later. 
- Always be a student.
- Appreciate, forgive, and be kind to team members of all levels.

## Recent TILs

    Findings when I had to implement Elastic Search.

- [Python datetimes (part-1)](./Python-Datetime-Part-1/index.md)
  
    A good deep-dive into a bug and learning quirks about datetimes.
